			<h4>Hour of code review</h4>
			I finally finished the hour of code(hour of waiting moreso than code).
			The web servers for the website or our internet conection had failed and everything was extremely slow.
			It was simple and easy but it's meant for complete beginners to coding and doesn't <i>really</i> teach you code unless you exclusively look at the show code features it offers.
			It's a simple thing that <b>only</b> covered how to use some flow control(if, while) and calling pre-determined functions that were never explained.
			Overall from my perspective I had gained nothing from it other than practice a little bit on my flow control skills because I know how all of the code works before I even drag the box selections around to finish the puzzles.
			For anyone that knows a little bit about code(knows at least how it works and can make a few things) most likely would use this as a tiny practice session and skip ahead to just brush up on their flow control skills but overall it's not entirely beneficial to them but it's great for absolute beginners.
