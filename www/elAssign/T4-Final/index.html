				<h2>Who is this 4chan?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="boxcontent">
				<p>
					4chan is an English imageboard-type website infamous for doing bad things and slightly illegal activities, it's personally my favourite site because there is almost never a dull moment. *wink wonk*
					The website is in an "imageboard" format, where people create "threads" for various topics, to ask for help, or just for fun. People reply to the
					threads, most of the time with relevant content but some people deviate from the topic and post their own stuff; this could be to troll people,
					"hijack" a thread, or just someone being stupid (AKA voice their opinions).
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					You never need to sign up for 4chan, everyone is anonymous and anyone can post whatever they want with only remote threat of accountability for what they have said.
					Everyone being anonymous also includes you cannot "message" other users or establish any kind of social relationship without one of you publicly displaying information.
					Being a social network, this is weird to a lot of people and even sociologists have spent time just attempting to figure out how it works.
				</p>

				<p>
					Christopher Poole, also known by his alias "Moot" created 4chan in his bedroom with the means to be an American counterpart to Futaba Channel as a place to discuss Japanese comics and
					Japanese TV shows known as Anime. The website quickly gained popularity and other boards were created to accomodate the diversity of the new members

				<h2>What does 4chan do?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="boxcontent">
				<p>
					Some of the things 4chan has done in the past doesn't really need to be said but a simple google search for 4chan you get results
					with peoples who's lives were ruined because they posted something, 4chan made fake advertising for the "Apple Wave" where people microwaved their iPhones,
					they started and hosted pretty much all of that one time iCloud was cracked into and many celebrities nude photos were leaked, as well as many cases of the anonymous users "raiding"
					websites which basically means a bunch of users posting things users from the website they are raiding don't want, and even sometimes hacking into the servers to freeze the domain or remove things.
					Most of the time when they raid, it's generally because they don't like that group because they quarrel with 4chan because of the nature of the website.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Most of the time all of this "bad" stuff happens because it gains popularity on the /b/ board (random board) where there is nearly no rules and moderators are pretty lenient and it just takes off.
